README For MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming

Context:
The enclosed problem sets reflect my original work in taking the MIT Introduction to Computer Science and Programming (Intro600) class through Open Courseware from Q3-Q4 2015. The class can be accessed to all at http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/electrical-engineering-and-computer-science/6-00sc-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-spring-2011/ , and I am incredibly grateful to MIT OCW for providing the opportunity to take classes in this way.

Authorship and originality:
Each problem set is provided by MIT with a .pdf of instructions for the problem set, a set of skeleton code, occasionally a set of unit tests, and occasionally with supplementary modules with pre-built functions or classes. 
Code provided by the intro 600 professors & TAs will be noted as such in the problem set instructions as pre-provided code. 
All other work is my own, based off of the skeleton code and problem set outlines. 
Solutions to these problems are provided, and while I completed each problem set without accessing the solutions I did re-review my code and refactor it to improve functionality for many problem sets. 
Many instances of this are noted in my self-improvement notes, available at: https://www.evernote.com/shard/s467/sh/59eb44c4-a050-449f-b8df-fe331a0bed86/3ff78019af669f0c019fea7f11242b20
