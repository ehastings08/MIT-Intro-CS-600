Your algorithms should be plain English explanations for the steps your program will take to solve these problems.

Problem 2: Find the decoding that produces the maximum number of words in an encoded text.

My Psuedocode:
Write out your algorithm for Problem 2 here:
Take the text as a string argument
For shift in range 0 to 27, decode text and create unshifted text
For word in unshifted text file, determine how many are real words
Keep track of a 'max' file based on # real words
Once iteration is complete, choose that file as the winner
Return shift #

Actual Pseudocode:
1. set the maximum number of real words found to 0
2. set the best shift to 0
3. for each possible shift from 0 to 27:
4. shift the entire text by this shift.
5. split the text up into a list of the individual words.
6. count the number of valid words in this list.
7. if this number of valid words is more than the maximum number of real words, then
8. record the number of valid words.
9. set the best shift to the current shift
10. increment the current possible shift by 1. Repeat the loop starting at 3.
11. return the best shift.
